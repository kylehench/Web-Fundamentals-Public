Tailwind installation guide: <https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation>  
1. Initialize package.json file.  
```npm init -y```  
2. Install tailwind as a dev dependency. (note: dev dependencies consist of all the packages that are used in a project's development phase and not in the production or testing environment with its version number)  
```npm install -D tailwindcss```
3. Add config file.  
```npx tailwindcss init```
Add appropriate paths to config. For simple project, add './*.html'.
4. Add the Tailwind directives to your CSS. Create input.css and add:  
```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```
5. Configure Tailwind CLI build process.  
package.json
```
"scripts": {
  "build": "tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./css/main.css",
  "watch": "tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./css/main.css --watch"
},
```



# Developing with Tailwind
Run ```npm run build``` to build or ```npm run watch``` to watch files for changes during development.
